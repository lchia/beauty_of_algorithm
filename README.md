These code comes from "Beauty of Algorithm, Zuo Fei (C++ version)".


Some of the codes in the book are wrong, for example: example 4.3.4 (Page 108), which named "c04_list/magic_card.cpp". The error was modified in the "magic_card.cpp", where I labeled with "modified by lch (50~62)".

All the codes were tested on Ubuntu 16.04 using g++, for example: 
	$cd c04_list/
	$g++ magic_card.cpp -o magic_card
	$./magic_card
and it will print as following:
	1*5*2*9*10*3*13*7*8*4*6*12*11*
which is the order of the 13 cards.
